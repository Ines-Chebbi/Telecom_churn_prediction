# Telecom_churn_prediction
Telecom churn prediction involves analyzing customer data to forecast which subscribers are likely to leave a telecommunications service provider. By leveraging historical data on customer behavior, usage patterns, and service interactions, telecom companies can identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them. The prediction process typically includes analyzing features such as customer tenure, service usage, billing information, and customer complaints. Advanced machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, are often employed to build predictive models. Effective churn prediction enables telecom companies to reduce customer turnover, improve satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance.
